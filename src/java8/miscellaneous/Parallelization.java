/**
 * when we use parallel(), Java splits the stream into multiple streams and execute the operation in those
 * streams in a parallel approach on multiple cores of the machine and finally combine all the results....thus saving time.
 *
 * in traditional approach as shown below
 *              int sum = 0;
 *              for(int num:numbers){
 *                  sum += num;
 *              }
 *              return sum;
 * The addition can not be run on multiple cores because the value of variable "sum" keeps on changing. So we can not use parallel()
 * in here.
