 * 
 * Before Java 8, interfaces could have only abstract methods. The
 * implementation of these methods has to be provided in a separate class. So,
 * if a new method is to be added in an interface, then its implementation code
 * has to be provided in the class implementing the same interface. To overcome
 * this issue, Java 8 has introduced the concept of default methods which allow
 * the interfaces to have methods with implementation without affecting the
 * classes that implement the interface.
